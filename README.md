Make a JMeter performance test plan and document the results as a pdf file.

The minimal requirement for the plan (for 40points):

1 sampler
1 assertion
1 listener

For better grades:

additional samplers for filling a form (for example login) and additional assertions checking the result (for +20  points)

additional usage of timers and using at least 3 types of listeners (for +20 points)

additional usage of a logic controller (for + 20 points)

Requirements for the documentation:

Short description of the goal and exceptions.

Description of the test environment and the plan.

Results from a few runs with at least 3 different setups regarding threads (number, timing, etc).

Conclusion.

You should upload 1 JMX and 1 pdf file.
